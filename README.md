# GRAPHS
This repository contains graph algorithms related to searching specifically BFS and DFS.
The BFS_and_DFS codes alreagy contain a graph in the main body of the cpp code. The graph has been visualised at the end of the code.
All the required functions are tested and the tests are commented in the main body of the program.

Topological sort

Problem solutions to the assignment 2 are topologicalsort1&2, SCC_partition, Giant_pizza.cpp.
